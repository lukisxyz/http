# Simple HTTP Server

You're asked to create a simple http server that serve a POST request and give a somekind of message what ever it is. On this challenge you're forbidden from using a high level framework or library about HTTP, just listen from your socket and parse manually.

I will create in 3 different language:
- Typescript using Deno (done)
- Go Language (done)
- Rust language (not yet, learn language first)
